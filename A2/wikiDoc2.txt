Driving testFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaA driving test (also known as a driving exam) is a procedure designed to test a person's ability to drive a motor vehicle. It exists in various forms worldwide, and is often a requirement for obtaining a driver's license. A driving test generally consists of one or two parts: a practical test, called a road test[1], used to assess a person's driving ability under normal operating conditions,[2] and/or a written or oral test to confirm a person's knowledge of driving and relevant rules and laws.[3]The driving test tends to change every few years with additional tests being introduced: an example of this is the Hazard Perception test now included in the United Kingdom driving test.
